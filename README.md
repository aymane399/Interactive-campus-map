## About Android Studio:

 Upon pulling some changes might be necessary for the proper functioning of the files like changing some absolute paths in the build      files.

## Functionalities of the app:

 It should allow the user to:

 - Locate themselves:
  This is done by displaying the map using the API and by highlighting the buildings selected used a search bar.

 - Find an itinerary between two buildings:
 Again by highlighting the two buildings.

 - Display useful information about the buildings:
 An info window is opened when the user clicks on the building, it contains information related to the building (opening and closing    hours, etc...)

 - Locate themselves inside a building:
 Detailed plans of each floor will be displayed and the room of interest would be highlighted using a search bar (not complet yet)
 PS : the buildings plan will not be available in this git for security reasons.

 This should be done with respect to the following constraints:

 - Application fluency:
 Data shouldn't be too large and the app should work even of low performance phones.

 - Ergonomy:
 The application must be intuitive and easy to use.
